\subsection{History of \ehi}
\input{Background/php.tex}
We found the first \ehi description in a late 2004 article on phpsecure.info~\cite{Tobozo} accredited to user \lstinline|tobozo| describing how an \ehi vulnerability existed in the implementation of the \texttt{mail()} function in PHP and how it can be exploited. More recently, a blog post by Damon Kohler~\cite{DK} and an accompanying wiki article~\cite{Injection} describe the attack vector and outline few defense measures for \ehi vulnerabilities.

%% As this vulnerability was initially found in the \texttt{mail()} function of PHP, \ehi can be traced to as early as the beginning of the 2000's, present in the \texttt{mail()} implementation of PHP 4.0. 

An example of the vulnerable code written in PHP is shown in Listing~\ref{code:phpemi}. This code takes in user input from the PHP superglobal \texttt{\$\_REQUEST[\textquotesingle email\textquotesingle]}, and stores it in the variable \texttt{\$from}, which is later passed to the \texttt{mail()} function to construct and send the e-mail.

\begin{sloppypar}
When this code is given the malicious input \texttt{\lstinline{abc@example.com\\nCC:spc@example.com}} as the value of the \texttt{\$\_REQUEST[\textquotesingle email\textquotesingle]}, it generates the equivalent SMTP Headers shown in Listing~\ref{code:smtpheaders}. It can be seen that the \texttt{CC} (carbon copy) header that we injected appears as part of the resulting SMTP message. This will make the e-mail get sent to the e-mail address specified as part of the \texttt{CC} as well.

%TODO Adam: added this para abt E-Mail Header Injection history from CVE
We gathered reported Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
(CVE)~\cite{cve} to get an idea of the distribution of
reported \ehi vulnerabilities over time. From the 28 reports we found (Table~\ref*{tab:history}), it can be seen that even though many vulnerabilities were found in earlier years (2005-07), there have been recently discovered \ehi vulnerabilities which suggests that it is still a very real and relevant threat to modern web security.
