\section{History of E-Mail Injection}

E-Mail Header Injection seems to have been first documented over a decade ago, in a late 2004 article on phpsecure.info \cite{Tobozo} accredited to user \lstinline|tobozo@phpsecure.info| describing how this vulnerability existed in the reference implementation of the \dq{\texttt{mail}} function in PHP, and how it can be exploited. More recently, a blog post by Damon Kohler \cite{DK} and an accompanying wiki article \cite{Injection} describe the attack vector and outline a few defense measures for the same.

As this vulnerability was initially found in the \emph{mail()} function of PHP, E-Mail Header Injection can be traced to as early as the beginning of the 2000's, present in the \emph{mail()} implementation of PHP 4.0. 

The vulnerability was also described briefly (less than a page) by Stuttard and Pinto in their widely acclaimed book, ``\emph{The Web Application Hacker's Handbook: Discovering and Exploiting Security Flaws}'' \cite{stuttard2011web}. 
A concise timeline of the vulnerability is presented in Table~\ref{tab:history}.

An example of the vulnerable code written in PHP is shown in Listing~\ref{code:phpemi}. This code takes in user input from the PHP superglobal \dq{\texttt{\$\_REQUEST[\textquotesingle email\textquotesingle]}}, and stores it in the variable \dq{\texttt{\$from}}, which is later passed to the \dq{\texttt{mail}} function to construct and send the e-mail.

When this code is given the malicious input \dq{\texttt{\lstinline{sai@sai.com\\nBCC:spc@spc.com}}} as the value of the \dq{\texttt{\$\_REQUEST[\textquotesingle email\textquotesingle]}}, it generates the SMTP Headers shown in Listing~\ref{code:smtpheaders}. It can be seen that the `CC' (carbon copy) header that we injected appears as part of the resulting SMTP message. This will make the e-mail get sent to the e-mail address specified as part of the `CC' as well.
