### Introduction
* This is my thesis docs repo, where I will be (quite obviously) uploading my thesis docs.
* Thanks to Dr. Shumway and his github repo, which you can find here: https://github.com/shumway/asudis
* I used the following tools to make my thesis writing a loooot easier:
	*(Will update this list)
	* TeXStudio --> Is very good, allows you to define macros and has a nice pdf viewer.
	* Mendeley --> Allows you to export BiBTeX, which is cool.
	* Mendeley plugin for FireFox/Chrome --> Allows you to save stuff to Mendeley for easy BiBTeX later :)
	* Thesaurus.com --> Cool.
	* Grammarly --> Self-explanatory.
	* Microsoft Excel for Tables, then use a Macro to o/p them to LaTeX, using Sublime to regex-replace.
	* Wikipedia BiBTeX generator - http://irl.github.io/bibwiki/
	* Google Scholar --> Cite BiBTeX.
