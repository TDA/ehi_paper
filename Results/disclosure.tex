\subsection{Responsible Disclosure of Discovered Vulnerabilities}
After we discovered an \ehi vulnerability on a particular website, we attempted to notify the developers of the vulnerable web application, along with a brief description of the vulnerability.
We chose to \email the following mailboxes, following the rules specified in RFC~2142~\cite{rfc2142}:
% Adam: don't we use \texttt for all the email addresses in the paper? We should use the same thing here
\begin{itemize}
	\item security@domain.com - Used for Security bulletins or queries.
	\item admin@domain.com - Used to contact the administrator of a website.
	\item webmaster@domain.com - Synonym for administrator, same functionality as admin.
\end{itemize}

% Adam: sai, is this number up-to-date? 
Out of the \domains\ vulnerable domains found, only 108 websites had the mailboxes able to receive \emails. For the remaining domains, we used the \texttt{whois}~\cite{whois} data to find the contact details of the owner, then we \emailed. The number of emails we sent and the number of developer responses we received is shown in Table~\ref{tab:devresp}.

\end{table}

% Adam: did we get updated notifications?
We received 13 developer responses, confirming 9 discovered vulnerabilities. Two of the developers fixed the vulnerability on their website.
% is this done?
From our research, it is clear that \ehi is quite widespread as a vulnerability, appearing on \successDelta\ of forms that we were able to perform automated attacks on. This value acts as a \emph{lower bound} for prevalence of \ehi vulnerability, and can quite easily be larger if the attacks were broader, crafted for the individual web application, and  less automated.
