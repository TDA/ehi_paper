\subsection{Exploitation Evidence}
We compared the \ips IPs that our system found to be vulnerable to 13 well-known IP blacklists, to see if these IPs were being exploited by attackers to send spam. The blacklists that we used were: 
\texttt{zen.spamhaus.org},
\texttt{spam.abuse.ch},
\texttt{cbl.abuseat.org},
\texttt{virbl.dnsbl.bit.nl},
\texttt{dnsbl.inps.de},
\texttt{ix.dnsbl.manitu.net},
\texttt{dnsbl.sorbs.net},
\texttt{bl.spamcannibal.org},
\texttt{bl.spamcop.net},
\texttt{dnsbl-1.uceprotect.net},
\texttt{dnsbl-2.uceprotect.net},
\texttt{dnsbl-3.uceprotect.net},
\texttt{db.wpbl.info}

We found that \ipsblacklist of these IPs were already blacklisted on at least one of the above blacklists for sending out spam, and \ipsblacklistmulti of them were found on multiple blacklists. We do not have enough data to make an observation about whether these attackers are exploiting \ehi to send out the spam, but suspect that there is a high possibility for the same.
